TASK---5
Step 1 : Import libraries,
         pandas - for data manipulation and analysis.
         numpy - for numerical computing.
         matplotlib.pyplot - for creating static , animated , and interactive visualizations.
         StandardScaler - a feature scaling technique used in data preprocessing for machine learning.
         LabelEncoder - used to convert categorical labels into numerical labels. 
         train_test_split - this function is used to split a dataset into training and testing sets.
         KNeighborsClassifier - used to implement the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm.
         accuracy_score - used to calculate the accuracy of a classification model. It quantifies how well a model's predictions match the true labels.
         confusion_matrix - to evaluate the performance of a classification model.
         ListedColormap - used to create a custom colormap from a list of specified colors.
Step 2 : Load the dataset.
Step 3 : Drop ID column.
Step 4 : Encode target labels.
Step 5 : Features and target.
Step 6 : Normalize features.
Step 7 : Split into training and test sets.
Step 8 : Experiment with different values of K.
Step 9 : Visualize decision boundary (only using 2 features for visualization), Use first two features for plotting.
Step 10 : Plotting decision boundaries.
