TASK---5
Step 1 : Import libraries,
         pandas - for data manipulation and analysis.
         matplotlib.pyplot - for creating static , animated , and interactive visualizations.
         seaborn - for better looking plots.
         train_test_split - this function is used to split a dataset into training and testing sets.
         cross_val_score -  used to perform K-Fold cross-validation and obtain a score for each fold.
         DecisionTreeClassifier - a class capable of performing multi-class classification on a dataset.
         plot_tree - used for visualizing decision trees, particularly within the context of machine learning models.
         RandomForestClassifier - used for classification tasks. It operates by constructing a "forest" of multiple decision trees during training and then aggregating their individual predictions to make a more robust and accurate final prediction.
         accuracy_score - used to calculate the accuracy of a classification model. It quantifies how well a model's predictions match the true labels.
         confusion_matrix - to evaluate the performance of a classification model.
         classification_report - used to generate a detailed summary of the performance of a classification model.
         StandardScaler - a feature scaling technique used in data preprocessing for machine learning.
Step 2 : Load the dataset.
Step 3 : Drop target column.
Step 4 : Normalize features.
Step 5 : Split into training and test sets.
Step 6 : Train and visualize Decision Tree.
Step 7 : Analyze overfitting with depth control , using desicion tree classifier.
Step 8 : Interpret feature importances.
Step 9 : Cross-validation comparison.
